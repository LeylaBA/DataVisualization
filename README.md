# DataVisualization
Some of the assignments I worked on thorough one semester in the Data Visualization course. Please consider that these assignments were done in a certain time schedule and I have not done any corrections on them at the time being. The files are merely here to show some of the content of the course that I have taken. The files are html saves of the actual Jupyter Notebook files that I have worked on.
